    1. Real-Time APR Rewards Real-Time APR applies to the total asset amount
    you deposit in each Flexible Product. Real-Time APR rewards are accrued
    and directly accumulated in your Earn Wallet from the next minute after
    subscription. Real-Time APR is subject to change every minute.
    <br/>
    2. Bonus Tiered APR Rewards Subscription Date 2025-10-27 10:33 Accrual
    Start 2025-10-28 09:00 First Distribution 2025-10-29 09:00 Binance may
    offer Bonus Tiered APR Rewards from time to time on selected Flexible
    Products through a tiered rate structure. These rewards are accrued the
    day after subscription, starting at 09:00 local time and distributed in
    your Spot Wallet the day after accrual starts (two days after
    subscription) between 09:00 and 17:00 local time. This APR is subject to
    change on a daily basis.
    <br/>
    3. Redemption Your Flexible Product assets will be returned to your Spot
    Wallet immediately upon successful processing of redemption requests.
    However, daily redemption limits apply to each Flexible Product, and are
    subject to change at any time. The assets you deposit in Simple Earn may
    be loaned to other Binance users (e.g. Margin and Crypto Loan products). A
    large amount of redemption requests might delay redemption temporarily.
    Redemptions may resume upon return of liquidity provided by, without
    limitation, actions like closing of borrower positions
